```

### avatar
`avatar( mixed/null/array $args=null )`

**returns:** `string/\Timber\Image` The avatar URL.

Gets a user’s avatar URL.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $args | `mixed/null/array` | Parameters for [`get_avatar_url()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_avatar_url/). |


Get a user avatar with a width and height of 150px:
**Twig**
```twig
<img src="{{ post.author.avatar({ size: 150 }) }}">
```

---

### can
`can( string $capability )`

**returns:** `bool` Whether the user has the capability.

Checks whether a user has a capability.

Don’t use role slugs for capability checks. While checking against a role in place of a
capability is supported in part, this practice is discouraged as it may produce unreliable
results. This includes cases where you want to check whether a user is registered. If you
want to check whether a user is a Subscriber, use `{{ user.can('read') }}`. If you only want
to check whether a user is logged in, you can use `{% if user %}`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $capability | `string` | The capability to check. |


Give moderation users another CSS class to style them differently.
**Twig**
```twig
<span class="comment-author {{ comment.author.can('moderate_comments') ? 'comment-author--is-moderator }}">
    {{ comment.author.name }}
</span>
```

### path
`path( )`

### roles
`roles( )`

**returns:** `array/null`

Roles shouldn’t be used to check whether a user has a capability. Use roles only for
displaying purposes. For example, if you want to display the name of the subscription a user
has on the site behind a paywall.

If you want to check for capabilities, use `{{ user.can('capability') }}`. If you only want
to check whether a user is logged in, you can use `{% if user %}`.

**Twig**
```twig
<h2>Role name</h2>
{% for role in post.author.roles %}
    {{ role }}
{% endfor %}
```
**Twig**
```twig
<h2>Role name</h2>
